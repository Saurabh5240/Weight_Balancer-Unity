This assignment is created for "Vignam - Unity Developer Internship".   
This simulation prototype has following features ---   
1) There are 6 objects in the scene all with random mass.
2) There is a weight balancer where user can pick and drag and put the weights on left or right side to balance it.   
3) There is a equation at bottom of screen which compares weights on both sides.   
4) If the weights is balanced on both sides a "Balanced!!" text appears.   
5) User can reset the scene anytime.   
6) If the weights is put on one side it cannot be used again to maintain weight balance.


 Here is demo of the prototype and some screenshots ---
